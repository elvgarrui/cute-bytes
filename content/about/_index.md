**Who am I?**

My name is **Elvira**, and I'm a software engineer from Seville. My main insterests are **Computation** and **Artificial Intelligence** (I'm currently finishing my MsC on that!!). I'd really love to contribute to society by applying everything I learn, and that's why my current goal is to be able to make a PhD and become a researcher and a professor.

That's also the reason why I believe that **free software** (free as in freedom) is the key that can lead to a *better*, **more respectful** and **more efficient** world.

**On this year (2019), I've been able to achieve some cool stuff:**
  
  - I've visited the European Parlament in order to fight against the pretty much known **#Article13**, where I had the opportunity to talk with many different politicians with different points of view on the matter! **Thanks to [Edri](https://edri.org/) for giving the [SUGUS GNU/LINUX](https://sugus.eii.us.es/) association such an opportunity.**
  - **[I've published a paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/21/4639)** next to an amazing research group from my University! We analyzed how to create models of cellular growth with **statistical learning**, using a pretty cool device that monitored the cells through their **electrical impedance measurements**.

**What's this blog about?**

I'm starting this blog based on 3 main reasons:
 
 1. I would like to write a bit about the things I'm learning, so that I don't forget them. 
 2. I want to make things I know and learn **accesible** to other people in a **divulgative** way.
 3. Not everything needs to be technical: If I feel the need of talking about ethical issues - or any other problems that revolve around the IT world - this blog is also intended to be a place where I can peacefully write my own point of view (which will be clearly separated from actual technical posts).

 I will try to add references in every post I make in order to make the information trustworthy. Anyway, I'm not perfect and I'm far away from considering myself *senior* in any way of the word:
 **Please do not hesitate to contact me if you spot any mistake in this blog.** I will be more than happy to improve my content!

 **Anything else?**

 Well, if you want to know a bit more about me, I guess I could talk about myself:

  - **I own a cat.** Her name is  :sparkles:**Sofi**:sparkles: and she's in love with my PC keyboard! I usually have to be careful about that.
  
  - **I'm part of the [SUGUS GNU/LINUX association](https://sugus.eii.us.es/)** (and I love it).
  
  - **I love playing board games**. My whole family loves it. **Really**. It's kinda scary. We can spend *days and days and days...* playing during summer. Right now we are really into playing a game called [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames).

  - **My main hobby is drawing**, mostly digital! The main picture of this blog was made by me. I have some [social accounts](https://twitter.com/dunareenArt) in relation to this, but I don't upload much content - my work and studies take most of my time.
  
  - **My main language is Spanish:** Furthermore, I'm really proud of my [**andalusian**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BphDStCnz1Y) accent and origins. 

  - **I care about what's happening around the world.** I have opinions formed around many different matters. Summing all it up: I would call myself a **feminist**, **pro human-rights** and a **pacifist** person. And please, do not throw your rubbish on the streets. **Recycle**.
