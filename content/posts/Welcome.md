Hi! I'm Elvira. You may wondering **what this blog is about**, so I'm going to try and disclose it briefly on this post: 

- I would like to write a bit about the things I’m learning, so that I don’t forget them.

- I want to make things I know and learn accesible to other people in a divulgative way.

- Not everything needs to be technical: If I feel the need of talking about ethical issues - or any other problems that revolve around the IT world - this blog is also intended to be a place where I can peacefully write my own point of view (which will be clearly separated from actual technical posts).

I will try to add references in every post I make in order to make the information trustworthy. Anyway, I’m not perfect and I’m far away from considering myself senior in any way of the word: **Please do not hesitate to contact me if you spot any mistake in this blog.** I will be more than happy to improve my content!
